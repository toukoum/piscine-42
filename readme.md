## ‚úíÔ∏è Feedback from the "Piscine"

After 2Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ hours of coding, three 4Ô∏è‚É£hour exams, and a final 8Ô∏è‚É£hour exam, I survived, and I want you to survive too.

I truly gave it my all, and I'm genuinely thrilled with this insane experience. It's a month out of time, where you'll think, sleep, and do only things related to coding.

=> I finished 7Ô∏è‚É£th in the ranking of my "piscine" (Level 10.6%).

`#Force et Honneur`

## üêà Course overview of the "Piscine" operations

The "piscine" is broken down into three types of tasks.

* The Days: exercises we had to complete every day individually (often algorithms of all kinds, or recoding existing functions).

* The Rush: group projects during the weekends, very challenging to complete. I succeeded in all of them, but I only fully validated the first one because the grading is extremely strict. For instance, for the second rush, we got a score of 0 because we forgot to free() a malloc... (literally two missing lines out of 900 in total).

* And finally, the exams: every Friday, all the computers switch to exam mode. Then, in an almost military-like atmosphere, we have a series of exercises to complete without ANY help, ranging from the easiest to the hardest. The catch is that to move on to the next exercise, you have to validate the current one. A very tricky rule that tripped up many.

## ü§ù Tips for succeeding under the best conditions

1. SLEEP a maximum of 5 hours/day. Prioritize pulling all-nighters at all costs over 8-hour sleeps that actually let you recover.

2. EAT healthily. Don't just feed on pizzas. There's also an amazing Burger King and a fabulous Tacos place, not to mention the delightful Asian restaurant (though it's a bit annoying since it's expensive...).

3. CONSTANTLY compare yourself to others. You absolutely need to be the best. If that's not the case, immediately quit the "piscine".

4. ESPECIALLY don't talk to anyone. If you need help or if someone asks you for help, ignore them and don't even look at them.

5. AND one last useful tip: never exceed 2 hours of daily coding. It's not recommended and it's pointless anyway.

There you have it. If you meticulously follow all this advice to the letter, you're giving yourself the best chance to be accepted.
